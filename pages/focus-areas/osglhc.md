  The Open Science Grid (OSG) provides common service and support for resource providers
  and scientific institutions using a distributed fabric of high throughput computational services.
  The OSG does not own resources but provides software and services to users
  and resource providers alike to enable the opportunistic usage and sharing of resources.

  OSG brings together many experiments for contracted and/or opportunistic
  sharing of resources in a grid environment, allowing for more effective use of their collective resources.
  Use of resources at a site is determined by a combination of the siteâ€™s local policies and the experimental organization policies.


  For more information, see the [OSG home page](https://opensciencegrid.org).
