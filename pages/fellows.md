# IRIS-HEP Fellows Program

  People are the key to successful software. IRIS-HEP aims to promote the 
development of advanced research software skills by providing opportunities 
for undergradute and graduate students to connect with mentors within the
larger HEP and Computational/Data Science community. At the same time, we aim 
to promote software as a collaborative activity and encourage collaborations 
which engage individuals in ways that maximize their potential and their 
potential impact on the community.

  In order to accomplish these goals, IRIS-HEP has created a Fellow program.
IRIS-HEP Fellows will spend 2-3 months working closely with a mentor on an
R&D topic relevant to the Institute. Possible software R&D areas include:

  * Analysis Systems
  * Innovative Algorithms
  * Data Organization, Management and Access
  * Scalable Systems
  * Tools and Material to support Training activities

It is *not* required that the mentors are IRIS-HEP team members, any 
appropriate mentor from the larger community working in one of these areas
can be part of the program.

  Two types of IRIS-HEP Fellows are possible:

  * *IRIS-HEP Graduate Fellows* - Graduate fellows spend 3 months working with a mentor in the home location of the mentor developing research software relevant for HEP ine one of the R&D areas listed above. Fellows are expected to have a base research stipend, but receive a montly subsistence plus travel expenses from their IRIS-HEP fellowship.
  * *IRIS-HEP Undergraduate Fellows* - Undergraduate fellows work with mentors in their local home institution for 10-12 weeks, either developing or using research software relevant for HEP in the categories listed above. Undergraduate fellows receive a monthly stipend during their fellowship. In rare cases, travel support may be available. Undergraduate fellows will

  Examples fellows in a related program can be found on the [DIANA/HEP Fellow webpage](http://diana-hep.org/pages/fellows.html) and example projects of interest in the HEP community can be found on the [HEP Software Foundation Google Summer of Code (HSF GSoC) webpage](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/gsoc.html). While GSoC is a separate program, funded by Google, many of the projects could also be appropriate for IRIS-HEP Fellows if they are within the R&D areas listed above.

Interested prospective fellows and/or mentors should write to fellows@iris-hep.org for more information.
