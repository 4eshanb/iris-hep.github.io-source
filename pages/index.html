IRIS-HEP is the third software institute funded by the National Science Foundation. The Institute will drive the research needed to meet the computational and data science challenges of high energy physics in the 2020s, including in particular the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN. The HL-LHC and other planned HEP facilities are discovery machines, which aim to understand the fundamental building blocks of nature and their interactions.

The IRIS-HEP project was funded on 1 September, 2018, and is ramping up its activities. Please check back to this website for further information.
