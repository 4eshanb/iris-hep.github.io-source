## Glossary

A significant amount of jargon and acronyms are used in presentations and
discussions about the IRIS-HEP software institution, the Large Hadron Collider
program at CERN and HEP in general. This glossary attempts to provide some
light on what these terms and acronyms mean.  (See also the list of [Related Projects](https://iris-hep.org/collaborations) for additional acronyms/names and explanations.)

  * AS - [Analysis Systems](https://iris-hep.org/as.html), one of the R&D focus areas of the [IRIS-HEP Software Institute](https://iris-hep.org/)

  * Blueprint - The [Blueprint](https://iris-hep.org/blueprint.html) activity in the IRIS-HEP Software Institute is designed to inform the strategic vision of the institute through dedicated workshops on topics of interest to the institute's mission.

  * CERN - the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, located in Geneva, Switzerland

  * DOMA - [Data Organization, Management and Access](https://iris-hep.org/doma.html), one of the R&D focus areas of the [IRIS-HEP Software Institute](https://iris-hep.org/)

  * HSF - [HEP Software Foundation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/)

  * IA - Innovative Algorithms, one of the R&D focus areas of the [IRIS-HEP Software Institute](https://iris-hep.org/)

  * LHC - Large Hadron Collider, the proton-proton collider at CERN

  * Open Science Grid - 

  * Operations Programs or Ops Programs - 

  * PEP - Project Execution Plan

  * PTC - Programmatic Terms and Conditions, a document included in the IRIS-HEP award which includes agreements between NSF and Princeton University (and by extension the other institutions) as to how the IRIS-HEP project should be executed, how reporting should be done, etc.

  * Run 3 - 

  * Run 4 or HL-LHC - The LHC running period which nominally starts from 2026, with the upgraded high luminosity LHC and upgraded ATLAS and CMS detectors

  * S2I2-HEP - The original conceptualization project for the software institute. It produced both the [S2I2-HEP Strategic Plan](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06592)  and (working with the HEP Software Foundation) drove the [Community White Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982)  process.

  * US-CMS 

  * US-ATLAS - refers to either the 

  * US-LHC Ops or US-LHC Operations Programs - refers to the two
