### IRIS-HEP COVID-19 related activities


A number of IRIS-HEP team members are contributing to software and computing 
activities to meet the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the
broader impact and outreach activities of the Institute:

  
  * UCSD Professor Frank Wuerthwein and project scientist Igor Sfiligoi are
    working with the [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/) to enable 
    them to more easily scale out the work servers that farm tasks out to
    clients available to do computational work. This leverages the experience 
    of the [Open Science Grid](https://opensciencegrid.org/) and the 
    [LHC](https://iris-hep.org/osglhc.html) and is needed to remove 
    bottlenecks to exploiting the significant increase in resources being 
    provided to
    [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/) to help with the COVID-19
    challenges.

  * The [Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)](https://molssi.org/) is working with BioExcel is working on a COVID-19 Computational Molecular Data Exchange to help curate and provide the possibility of community review of the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 related computational molecular simulation datasets. IRIS-HEP is discussing with them ideas for how HEP infrastructure such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and the HEP data caching and distribution infrastructures might be something they can leverage as their curated data volumes increase.

  * Princeton postdoc Savannah Thais is organizing a session at the APS
    April meeting entitled "Physics Response to COVID-19".

  * Princeton researchers Peter Elmer, Henry Schreiner, David Lange and Jim
    Pivarski are writing the software for a patient flowmeter system for
    ventilators that allow up to 20 to monitored remotely by a nurse 
    in a field hospital. This works is being done in collaboration with 
    [Penn Medicine](https://www.pennmedicine.org/) and a number of other
    Princeton Physics and Neuroscience faculty. 

  * A number of IRIS-HEP researchers were involved in setting up the
    [Science Responds](https://science-responds.org/) to make connections 
    that enable (non-medical) researchers to contribute to understanding 
    and combating the global COVID-19 problem and/or its economic and 
    societal impacts. This website provides resources and information
    for such researchers. An associated Slack workspace and Zoom
    meetings allow researchers to interact. We have also recently begun
    organizing [talks and discussions](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12245/) 
    with non-Physics researchers. Some of these are being recorded and
    made available in a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeZvkLnDkqbQ1qIE7PA741dQUb1zw6FBd).
