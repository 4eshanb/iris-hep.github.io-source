  The Open Science Grid (OSG) provides common service and support for resource providers
  and scientific institutions using a distributed fabric of high throughput computing services.
  The OSG does not own resources but provides software and services to users
  and resource providers alike to enable the opportunistic usage and sharing of resources.

  OSG brings together many experiments for contracted and/or opportunistic
  sharing of resources in a grid environment, allowing for more effective use of their collective resources.
  
  U.S. ATLAS (contributing to ATLAS as a whole) relies extensively on services and software provided by OSG,
  as well as on processes and support systems that have been developed and implemented by OSG.
  OSG is essential for the operation of the worldwide-distributed ATLAS computing facility
  and the OSG efforts have aided the integration with WLCG partners in Europe and Asia.
  
  OSG provides infrastructure software maintenance and integration,
  through its packaging of all of the components that make up the OSG software releases.
  This software forms the backbone of the U.S. CMS distributed high-throughput computing efforts.
  OSG distributes the CMS software to U.S. CMS sites through its CernVM File System (CVMFS) service.
  It handles registration, monitoring and accounting activities for sites
  (the latter via the GRÃ…CC product), allowing CMS to track usage of OSG resources
  and then report it to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG).
