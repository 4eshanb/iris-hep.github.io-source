The very first Machine Learning Hackathon at the Physics Department
of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez took place on 24-26
April, 2019, organized by IRIS-HEP Training, Education and Outreach
coordinator (and UPRM physics professor) Sudhir Malik.

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical
model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on
the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and
make decisions with minimal human intervention.  While many machine
learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability
to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big
data repeatedly and ever faster is a recent development. Learning
these skill would make it possible to quickly and automatically
produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver
faster, more accurate results. ML techniques encompasses all STEM
fields. It is very essential that UPRM students learn these tools
early on to make good careers in future.  The
[agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/809812/timetable/) included
talks by UPRM researchers and faculty from the Mathematics, Physics
and CS&E departments. The topics included covered Statistics, ML
techniques and use cases from UPRM research activities. Dr. Sergei
Gleyzer, who is a physicist from University of Florida and expert
and convener of ML group at CMS Experiment. The participants will
be students from UPRM and will be given challenging problem to solve
during Hackathon.
