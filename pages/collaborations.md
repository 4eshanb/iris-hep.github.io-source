# Collaborations and Related Projects

The IRIS-HEP project and team members are part of a larger ecosystem of 
projects and collaborations focused on both high energy physics research and 
the development of software and computing systems to support science. These 
include:

### HEP Experiments

  * [The ATLAS experiment](https://home.cern/science/experiments/atlas) is a general-purpose detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and after significant upgrades, from 2026, at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC).
  * [The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) is a general-purpose detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and after significant upgrades, from 2026, at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC).
  * [The Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment](https://home.cern/science/experiments/lhcb) is a detector focused on physics using the beauty quark. 

### U.S. Collaborations

### Older Projects

  * [S2I2-HEP](http://s2i2-hep.org/) - The S2I2-HEP project prepared a strategic plan for a potential NSF Scientific Software Innovation Institute (S2I2), which evolved into what became the proposal to the NSF for IRIS-HEP. As part of that, the S2I2-HEP project worked closely with the HEP Software Foundation to prepare a larger HEP Community White Paper (CWP) describing a global roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s. -- [[NSF OAC-1558216](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1558216&HistoricalAwards=false), [NSF OAC=1558233](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1558233&HistoricalAwards=false), [NSF OAC-1558219](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1558219&HistoricalAwards=false)]
  * [DASPOS](http://daspos.org/) - This project ran from 2012-2017 and did an "initial exploration of the key technical problems that must be solved to provide appropriate data, software and algorithmic preservation for HEP, including the contexts necessary to understand, trust and reuse the data." As such, it contributed directly to some of the deelopment work performed by the [DIANA/HEP](http://diana-hep.org/) project and now as part of the [Analysis Systems](/as) area of IRIS-HEP. -- [[NSF PHY-1247316](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1247316)]
