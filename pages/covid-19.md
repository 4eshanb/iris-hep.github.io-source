# IRIS-HEP COVID-19 related activities

  Like many scientific research and research computing teams, IRIS-HEP
is working contribute its software and computing capabilities and team
in support of activities to meet the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Current Activities
  
  * UCSD Professor Frank Wuerthwein, project scientist Igor Sfiligoi and
    others from the [Open Science Grid](https://opensciencegrid.org/) team 
    are working with the [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/) team
    and Greg Bowman, the PI of Folding@Home, to understand how OSG can best 
    support their work related the COVID-19 challenges.

  * The [Molecular Sciences Software Institute
    (MolSSI)](https://molssi.org/) is working with [BioExcel](https://bioexcel.eu/) on a COVID-19 Computational Molecular Data Exchange to help 
    curate and provide the possibility of community review of the rapidly
    increasing number of COVID-19 related computational molecular
    simulation datasets. IRIS-HEP is discussing with them ideas for
    how HEP infrastructure such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and
    the HEP data caching and distribution infrastructures might be
    something they can leverage as their curated data volumes increase.

  * Princeton postdoc Savannah Thais is organizing a session at the APS
    April meeting entitled "Physics Response to COVID-19".

  * Princeton researchers Peter Elmer, Henry Schreiner, David Lange and Jim
    Pivarski are contributing the software for a patient presure and 
    flowmeter monitoring system for
    ventilators. The system allow up to 20 patients to be monitored remotely 
    by a nurse in a COVID-19 field hospital, with relevant alarms. This 
    outreach activity is being done in collaboration with 
    [Penn Medicine](https://www.pennmedicine.org/) and a number of other
    Princeton Physics, Mechanical Engineering and Neuroscience faculty. 
    The system includes data analysis algorithms, visualization and data 
    acquisition from sensor system (written in Python).

  * A number of IRIS-HEP researchers were involved in setting up the
    [Science Responds](https://science-responds.org/) to make connections 
    that enable (non-medical) researchers to contribute to understanding 
    and combating the global COVID-19 problem and/or its economic and 
    societal impacts. This website provides resources and information
    for such researchers. An associated Slack workspace and Zoom
    meetings allow researchers to interact. We have also recently begun
    organizing [talks and discussions](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12245/) 
    with non-Physics researchers. Some of these are being recorded and
    made available in a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeZvkLnDkqbQ1qIE7PA741dQUb1zw6FBd).

## Earlier Relevant Activities

  * Earlier IRIS-HEP work by the NYU Professor Kyle Cranmer and collaborators ("Efficient Probabilistic Inference in the Quest for Physics Beyond the Standard Model", 
[arXiv:1807.07706](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07706) has previously been extended for epidemiological studies such as "Hijacking Malaria Simulators with Probabilistic Programming", [arXiv:1905.12432](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12432).
