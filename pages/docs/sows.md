title: Information for preparing annual SOWs
---

  In order to prepare the annual Statement of Work (SOW) and annual subaward
budget, a budget justification should be prepared. This should contain the 
justification information normally expected from an NSF proposal budget
justification, plus several elements that we need to prepare the SOW. These
are the WBS cost breakdown table and the summary of costs.

## WBS cost breakdown table

|      |           |  Fully Loaded   | IRIS-HEP | WBS Fractions|       |
| Name | Job Type  | 12-month Salary | Fraction | (Sum to 1.0) | Notes |
| ---- | --------- | --------------- | -------- | -------------| ----- |
| Jane Doe | Postdoc | $123456| 0.5 | 1.0 OSG-LHC | |
| John Doe | Staff | $99999 | 1.0 | 0.5 DOMA, 0.5 MGMT | |
| TBN      | Grad Student | $76543 | 1.0  |    0.25 DOMA, 0.75 MGMT | |

Notes:
  * Specify fringe and indirect cost values used in the Notes
  * The "12-month fully loaded salary" is the equivalent annual salary cost, **including** the fringe and indirect costs, it is not the actual salary or the cost to IRIS-HEP. 
  * For special cases where grad student is included, please include that cost summed together with the salary and make a note about how it was calculated in the Notes
  * The cost to the IRIS-HEP project will be calcualted by multiplying the "12-month fully loaded salary" by the IRIS-HEP fraction.

The labels to use for the WBS areas are:

  * WBS1: Management (MGMT)
  * WBS2: Analysis Systems (AS)
  * WBS3: Data Organization, Management and Access (DOMA)
  * WBS4: Innovative Algorithms (IA)
  * WBS5: Software Sustainability Core (SSC)
  * WBS6: Scalable Systems Laboratory (SSL)
  * WBS7: OSG-LHC Services (OSG-LHC)
